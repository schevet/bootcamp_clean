You will also be responsible for preparing a 10 minute presentation.

This will be a formal presentation. 

One in which you explain in detail:

    Your overall application’s concept

    The motivation for its development

    Your design process

    The technologies you used (and briefly how they work)

    A demonstration of its functionality

    Directions for future development

Treat the presentation seriously! 

Talking intelligently about tech > doing tech sometimes.
